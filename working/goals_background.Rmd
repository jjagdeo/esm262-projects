Course goals: 
I am taking this course to satisfy the requirements of the Environmental Data Science focus. I am interested in furthering my skills with R and working on projects that could benefit my future career as an environmental professional. 

Data science background: 
I have taken Allison Horst's ESM 206 class and I am currently taking her ESM 244 Advanced Data Analysis class. Since being at Bren, I have utilized R extensively for my group project. Outside of Bren, I used R this past summer during my internship at a water consulting firm.
